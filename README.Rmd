## Overview

**`r desc::desc_get_field("Title")`:** `r desc::desc_get_field("Description")`

First presented as a [demo](https://jabenninghoff.github.io/security/analysis/rq-demo.html) in my
2024 [SIRAcon](https://societyinforisk.org) talk, "[UnFAIR: Simplifying and Expanding Technology Risk Quantification](https://www.information-safety.org/2024/08/29/siracon-2024/)."

A rendered version of the standalone sample report is available
[here](https://jabenninghoff.github.io/quantrr/sample/).

1. Download and extract the "standalone" directory from this repository.
1. Run `RScript setup.R` from the command line in the standalone directory to install required R
   packages.
1. Run `quarto preview` from the command line in the standalone directory to build and display the
   example analysis.
