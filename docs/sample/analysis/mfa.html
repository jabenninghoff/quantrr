<p>Background assumptions:</p>
<p>Professional services firm with $5M in annual revenue. A loss of 1% ($50K) is considered <a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/materiality-threshold-in-audits/">material</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cyentia.com/multi-incident-probabilities/">Supplementary Material</a> from the Cyentia IRIS 2025 Report found that the likelihood of at least 1 incident in the next year is 7.48% for firms with less than $10M in revenue.</p>
<p>Figure A3 from the main <a href="https://www.cyentia.com/iris2025/">IRIS 2025 Report</a> shows that the median loss for the Professional sector is $736K and the 95th percentile is $17M. From this we use trial and error to calculate the 50% (median) loss at $31,900.</p>
<p>According to a preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00945">study</a>, implementing MFA reduces the likelihood of compromise by 99%. An older <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313481">study</a> found that MFA reduced the likelihood of targeted attacks by 76%.</p>
<p>Note: the research on MFA looked at individuals, and other <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2024.2335461">research</a> on organizations found a lower reduction. For this analysis, we assume the individual risk reduction is achievable with a thorough and complete MFA implementation (fully implemented everywhere).</p>
</section><section id="import" class="level1"><h1>Import</h1>
<p>Import and validate data from Excel.</p>
<p>We use the IRIA 2025 data for the 5th, median, and 95th percentile of impact in all treatments, and adjust the frequency by 99% in the optimistic case and 76% in the pessimistic case.</p>
