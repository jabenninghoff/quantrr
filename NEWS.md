# quantrr 0.1.0

Initial release. Implements basic package structure and two core functions:

- `lnorm_param()`: calculate the parameters of a log normal distribution from the 0.05 and 0.95 quantiles

- `calc_risk()`: quantify risk using a Poisson distribution for loss event frequency, and a log-normal distribution for loss event magnitude
